Instructions:

1) Download this entire repository into one folder.
2) From http://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/database/data-sets download the preprocessed dataset into a "dataset" folder in the repository outside of where all the code is.  The data is A01T - A09E in the first data section.  
3) Using this data, you should be able to run the data on the default settings. python3 run_hd.py


Our unique lines of code come in the main_hd.py file where we created and printed the .predict() for each file in addition to doing the .fit().
